# Stock Forecaster 

A neural‑network–powered stock price forecasting dashboard built in Python, developed during 2024-2025 as part of an academic data visualization and forecasting project, turned into a personal project.

## Overview

- Fetches historical stock data (e.g. via `yfinance`)
- Builds and trains a neural network model using PyTorch Lightning
- Generates forecasts and visualizations via a dashboard interface
- Offers modular code for data collection, EDA, model training, and deployment

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Neural Network Forecasting** — Modular architecture supports experimentation with layers, sequence length, and other hyperparameters.
- **Interactive Dashboard** — Visualizes historical vs. predicted prices with user input options.
- **Reproducible Workflow** — Code is separated into clean modules for data, modeling, and visualization.

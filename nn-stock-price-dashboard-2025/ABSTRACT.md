Can Machine Learning provide better direction than technical indicators?

This project explores whether machine learning models can outperform traditional technical indicators in predicting stock price movements and market trends. Data for this analysis will be sourced from Yahoo Finance via the yfinance API, providing historical price data, trading volume, and additional financial metrics. The analysis will involve implementing machine learning models like NHITS and NBEATS for time-series forecasting, comparing their predictive accuracy to widely used technical indicators such as moving averages. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering will be employed to extract patterns and relationships in the data. Insights will focus on identifying whether machine learning methods can provide more reliable or timely buy/sell signals, improving decision-making for traders and investors. An interactive dashboard will visualize the findings, enabling users to explore model performance and interpretability in real time.
